						George Brown College is committed to creating the "benchmark" in service excellence to which others will aspire.  We need to work at understanding the needs and unique challenges our students face.  We need to dig deep in our quest to create the right student experience outside the classroom or lab.  As a service provider you have ongoing opportunities to contribute to and nurture that excellent student experience at George Brown College.  
						In this video, Anne Sado, President, shares her thoughts on how she believes you can play an important role in realizing our goal to be the leader in service excellence.

				<text>
					<![CDATA[
						In its 40 years of being in the heart of Toronto, George Brown College has become woven into the economic, cultural and social fabric of Toronto. George Brown College is one of Canada's largest, most diversified and highly respected colleges, serving a broad and vibrant student body with an incredibly rich program mix of diplomas, degrees, certificates and apprenticeship training.
						Every staff member contributes to making two key things happen for students at George Brown College – ensuring excellence in teaching and learning is a hallmark of a George Brown education and that our graduates are employer ready.
						The ultimate measure of our success is how many of our students graduate or go onto opportunities and careers that meet their goals.  Whether we contribute by cleaning, teaching students, designing programs, accepting fee payments, answering student inquiries or sitting on a committee we are all engaged in delivering services in support of our Academic Strategy.
						Picture for a second what happens if we fail to do our job…..
						If we fail to create a welcoming environment, a first generation student may become discouraged and start to question the decision to attend school. 
						If we fail to provide accurate and comprehensive answers and end up sending a prospective student from one person to another, the student may change their mind about going to George Brown.
						If we fail to probe to determine a student’s concern, the student feels staff are incompetent and can’t be relied on.
						George Brown is committed to delivering a ‘GBC standard’ of quality and superior performance. This tool is part of our commitment to help you enhance your customer service skills and to provide you with a library of resources crucial to your work.
						Please take the time to go through all of the modules in this tool.  I hope you will find it to be invaluable in serving our applicants and students.
						Wayne Poirier, Director – Student Service sand Campus Life.
