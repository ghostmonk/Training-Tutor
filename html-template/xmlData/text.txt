Some of the challenges we face in delivering remarkable customer service are:
• being the last to know – not in the loop
• misinterpretation of information or the customer’s query
• not having the necessary tools and resources
• difficulty collaborating with other departments
• dealing with customer frustration and anger
• communication barriers - language
• adequate support
• consistency
• deadlines
• StartUp: pressure, volume
• other departments not sharing the same values; having different standards
• explaining policies that are not ours
• agitation
• V.I.P. Treatment:  Each individual wants to be the exception to the rule
• customer having received misinformation
• pointing fingers:  blaming it on the first point of contact
• misdirected customers – frustrated
• impatient students and staff
• rude and aggressive behaviour from customers; lack of manners; abruptness
• customers that don’t know what they want; hard to provide the appropriate service
• customers that are unwilling to follow policy or are just ignorant of policy
• customers’ interpretation or comprehension of what’s been said
• relating to the many different customer types
• not being able to control the customer experience beyond our initial contact
• technology issues
• energy levelTo deal with these challenges it is important to know yourself, understand different communication styles, what is important when we are engaging with visitors or callers and being a self-leader.

PERSONAL STYLE INVENTORY

The first step to being able to face these challenges is to “Know Thyself”.  This is an informal survey, designed to determine how you usually act in everyday related situations. The idea is to get a clear description of how you see yourself.  
Click on the link below to access the Personal Style Inventory.  When you open the link you may be asked if you want to enable the macros.  Click yes then save the file to your desktop.  On the answer page, for each pair of statements click either A or B to show the one that MOST describes you.When you have completed it, save it again and email a copy to your manager.

ENGAGING WITH APPLICANTS/STUDENTS

In our roles of delivering remarkable Customer Care we are role models and leaders to each other and our customers.When delivering service here are four tips for engaging with our applicants/students.
Truth telling

Telling the truth is important.  If you aren’t sure of an answer or how to help a student, ask.  If the answer isn’t what the student wants to hear don’t imply that the answer may be different.  You lose credibility and ultimately the service area loses credibility

Promise Keeping

Be careful of the commitments you make to staff and customers and then be careful that you keep your promise. If we state they will receive an answer we need to conduct that follow-up.

Fairness

Make sure you employ the same rules for all customers.  Students become frustrated and confused when friends are able to have something done but they have been told it’s not permitted.  Be polite, be courteous, be consistent and be fair.

---------------------------------------------------

ENGAGING WITH APPLICANTS/STUDENTS

Respect for the individual
Telling the truth, keeping promises and being fair all show respect for the individual.  Respect means treating people with dignity.  Put yourself in the student’s shoes and treat them as you would want to be dealt with in a similar situation.

---------------------------------------------------

SELF LEADERSHIP

Effective service leaders reveal themselves through
• character
• relationships
• knowledge
• intuition
• experience
• past success
• ability

Three important attributes that enhance these qualities are 

• setting personal business goals
• using constructive self-criticism
• identifying learning and growth opportunities

--------------------------------------------------------

SETTING PERSONAL BUSINESS GOALS

Personal business goals can be as simple as deciding you will greet everyone with “How are you today?” or ending the transaction with “Have a nice day.”  It may sound clichéd but these simple niceties can in most cases help to start the visit off on a courteous, positive note.

Thinking back to engaging with our applicants/students take a moment to decide for yourself three changes you want to make in how you deal with visitors.  Record them separately or in your Outlook calendar so you can refer to them in a month or two to gauge your progress.

You can also use the feedback from Peer Coaching to identify 3 areas you want to improve.

----------------------------------------------------------   

CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM

Everyone has difficult days; we must remind ourselves of our strengths and positive attributes.  If we feel confident then it carries through to our interactions with visitors and staff.  

One of the most powerful influences on your attitude and personality is what you say to yourself. It is not what happens to you, but how you respond internally to what happens to you, that determines your thoughts, feelings, and your actions.

An easy way to start is to think of problems as situations.  For example, if you are having difficulty implementing your personal business goals rather than thinking “I’m never going to get it right.” break the situation down to discover what aspect of implementing your goals is presenting a challenge and find a solution.When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.  Figure out what you can do differently next time and don’t be afraid to ask others for their input.

And dealing with criticisms from other people becomes easier because you are no longer sensitive and have become approachable. You accept them as constructive criticisms and consider them as useful feedback to further your growth and development. 

LEARNING AND GROWTH

Looking for new learning opportunities allows you to maintain your interest and enthusiasm.  Learning opportunities can be formal such as courses and workshops, or informal such as talking with your colleagues or reading related articles.----------------------------------------------------------
